# Welcome to Scrabble!

**Scrabble** is a **word game** in which two to four players score points by placing tiles bearing a single letter onto a board divided into a 15Ã—15 grid of squares. The tiles must form **words** that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns, and be included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.
